/**
 * THEORY
 *
 * Goal -> Make a UI working within which is enjoyable which is already there, but I want to make it more, and more polished
 *
 * How? -> First make a Theme, which is easy to configure, maintain, along with testing contrast.
 *      -> Revising and revisiting, taking inspiration from other theme
 *      -> being consistent toward, The Improvement around the theme
 *      -> Exploring and Experiementing So, that new idea and possiblities should not be left behind.
 *      -> Last, Believing that it will become better overtime,
 *
 * > Never best but just better than before, cut from the race but ahead of it's time.
 *
 * So, today is 7-8-2022
 *
 * But it's ready started, 3days ago.
 *
 * APP BACKGROUND is darkest
 *
 * Workbench ->
 *  Title Bar
 *  Activity Bar
 *  Side Bar
 *  Panel
 *  Editor Group
 *  Status Bar
 *  * Editor don't be here but will be here
 *
 * COMPONENTS ->
 *  Button control âœ…
 *  Breadcrumbs colors
 *  Dropdown control
 *  Menu
 *  Menubar
 *  Banner colors
 *  Extensions colors
 *  Quick picker colors
 *  Keybinding label colors
 *  Input control
 *  Scrollbar control
 *  Badge
 *  Progress bar
 *  Lists and trees
 *
 * ðŸ‘†
 *    shared background is important, to be consistent,
 *    where it can be without distrubing the user experience.
 *
 *    # Visual Properties, to take into consideration are
 *      1. Foreground
 *      2. Background
 *      3. Border
 *      Shadow but, sometimes only it's just static most of the time.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *    States :- Default -> Hovered | Focused | Pressed -> Selected
 *              Selected -> Hovered | Focused | Pressed -> Default
 *
 *    Events Related to Editor :-
 *              Search -> Selection, ActiveSelection
 *              Editor Notifications - Warning, Info, Error
 *              Default (Current_Changing) ,Modified, Added, Deleted
 *
 *    After Analysing, I am thinking to confine the shades of colors to some extend without losing the flexiblity, over changing stuff to match level of satisfaction I want
 *
 *    So, For each visual property we want
 *                          high contrast -> Active
 *                          medium contrast -> Hover
 *                          medium contrast -> Show Dragging
 *                          low contrast -> InActive
 *    text can be defined in range of 50 to 400
 *
 *    selection highlight 300 to 500
 *
 *    border part 500 to 700
 *
 *    background part 700 to 1000
 *
 *    introduction to new colors keys,
 *
 *    $base $default $modified $added $deleted $error $warning $info $success $attention $highlight
